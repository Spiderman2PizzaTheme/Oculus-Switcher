# Oculus-Switcher
These are simple scripts I wrote that shuts down the Oculus runtime processes when you're not using your headset or starts it up when you want to play. Pre-compiled exe files have been made for you, but in case you don't trust them feel free to download the source code and compile them yourself.

I use this to convert batch files into exe files: https://github.com/npocmaka/batch.scripts

I also recommend downloading "NirCmd" and appending the code found in the "Change audio device" folder to the main .bat files if you want audio to come out of your rift straight away. Please note that you will need to change the name of the headphones and microphone to the names of your specific headphones and microphone in "Change back audio device.txt" in order for it to work. You can find the names of your devices by pressing "Win+R" then typing "mmsys.cpl". This will bring up a list of your playback and recording devices.
